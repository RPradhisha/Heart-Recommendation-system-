        "The main objectives of this project are:\n",
        "\n",
        "To predict the presence of heart disease using clinical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To compare multiple machine learning models for performance\n",

        "To prioritize recall to minimize missed disease cases\n",
        "\n",
        "To provide personalized lifestyle, diet, and medication category recommendations\n",

        "To build an interactive and explainable healthcare system\n",

        "FINAL INTERPRETATION\n",
        "This project focuses on building a correct, interpretable, and healthcare-relevant machine learning pipeline. While advanced features are planned for future phases, the current system successfully demonstrates predictive analytics, risk stratification, and safe medical recommendations.\n",
